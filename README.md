## Project - Emergency Covid Services

## About
The main aim of our project is to handle Emergency audio calls pertaining to Covid Resource Crisis and develop a user interactive application for connecting Covid affected people needing resources with volunteers having potential Covid relief resources.

## Objectives

* Who - Emergency Call Response Teams (Volunteers with relief information) and Covid affected people with no access to internet needing resources
* What - Addressing emergency help requests by connecting with volunteers who will be providing appropriate information.
* Why - A mass population in India does not have access to necessary resources when needed because there is a disconnect between people in need and the available resources. 
* When - Tentative period of one week.
